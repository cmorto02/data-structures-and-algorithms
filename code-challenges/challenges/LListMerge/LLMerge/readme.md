# Linked List Merge
This method zippers in the values of two linked lists of any size.

## Challenge
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1).

## Approach & Efficiency
Our Big O is O(n) for space and O(n) for time. 
I will be refactoring to get to O(1) for space.
