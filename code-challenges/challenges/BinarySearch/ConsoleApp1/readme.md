# Binary Search
A binary search searches through a sorted array for a specific value.

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
Our Big O is O(n) for space and O(Logn) for time. 
The approach we took halves the array each time it doesnt find the key, making this very efficient for large arrays.
